    <div class="col-md-4">Battle Royale (バトル・ロワイアル, Batoru rowaiaru) is a film, released on December 16, 2000 in Japan. It was based on the Battle Royale novel which was released on April 22, 1999 in Japan. It was directed by Kinji Fukasaku, and features Takeshi Kitano and Chiaki Kuriyama. Like the novel on which it is based, it aroused much controversy.A sequel, Battle Royale II: Requiem, followed. The musical soundtrack for both films was composed by Masamichi Amano, and features pieces of real classical music with some original composition.Fukasaku has stated that the novel reminded him of his time as a 15-year old munitions factory worker, so he decided to create the film adaptation</div>
      
    <div class="col-md-6">The film centres around Shuya Nanahara, a charismatic young boy. After his mother abandons him and his father commits suicide, he becomes disillusioned with life. The rest of his classmates are similarly disillusioned, and have little respect for authority. Shuya's best friend, Nobu, attacks their teacher Kitano, but runs away before he can be identified. Noriko, a sweet, reserved young girl who happens to witness the incident, hides the knife that Nobu has just attacked Kitano with. Kitano, frustrated, resigns.</div>
      
    <div class="col-md-4">At the dawn of the millennium, the nation collapsed. At 15% unemployment, 10 million were out of work. 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence, and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act... AKA: The BR Act.</div>
